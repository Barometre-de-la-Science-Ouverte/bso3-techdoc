However, software is usually not formally cited, but rather mentioned informally within the scholarly description of the investigation, raising the need for automatic information extraction and disambiguation. Given the lack of reliable ground truth data, we present SoMeSci-Software Mentions in Science-a gold standard knowledge graph of software mentions in scientific articles. It contains high quality annotations (IRR: K=.82) of 3756 software mentions in 1367 PubMed Central articles. Besides the plain mention of the software, we also provide relation labels for additional information, such as the version, the developer, a URL or citations. Moreover, we distinguish between different types, such as application, plugin or programming environment, as well as different types of mentions, such as usage or creation. To the best of our knowledge, SoMeSci is the most comprehensive corpus about software mentions in scientific articles, providing training samples for Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Entity Disambiguation, and Entity Linking. Finally, we sketch potential use cases and provide baseline results.},

Recently, a large number of studies have reported near-perfect results to distinguish between recordings of patients that will deliver term or preterm using a public resource, called the Term/Preterm Electrohysterogram database. However, we argue that these results are overly optimistic due to a methodological flaw being made. In this work, we focus on one specific type of methodological flaw: applying over-sampling before partitioning the data into mutually exclusive training and testing sets. We show how this causes the results to be biased using two artificial datasets and reproduce results of studies in which this flaw was identified. Moreover, we evaluate the actual impact of over-sampling on predictive performance, when applied prior to data partitioning, using the same methodologies of related studies, to provide a realistic view of these methodologies’ generalization capabilities. We make our research reproducible by providing all the code under an open license.}

	abstract = {Data citation, where products of research such as data sets, software, and tissue cultures are shared and acknowledged, is becoming more common in the era of Open Science. Currently, the practice of formal data citation—where data references are included alongside bibliographic references in the reference section of a publication—is uncommon. We examine the prevalence of data citation, documenting data sharing and reuse, in a sample of full text articles from the biological/biomedical sciences, the fields with the most public data sets available documented by the Data Citation Index (DCI). We develop a method that combines automated text extraction with human assessment for revealing candidate occurrences of data sharing and reuse by using terms that are most likely to indicate their occurrence. The analysis reveals that informal data citation in the main text of articles is far more common than formal data citations in the references of articles. As a result, data sharers do not receive documented credit for their data contributions in a similar way as authors do for their research articles because informal data citations are not recorded in sources such as the DCI. Ongoing challenges for the study of data citation are also outlined.},

Proponents of the data-sharing movement have advocated the citation of datasets in order to recognize contributions and enhance access. This study examines a sample of papers from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) Bibliography of Data-Related Literature that are based on secondary analysis of datasets available in the ICPSR data archive to determine the data citation practices of authors. The results indicate that many authors fail to cite the data used in secondary analysis studies. Possible reasons for the dismal state of data citation practices are considered, including the recent introduction of data into the scholarly record and its marginalization as an information format. Updating citation practices to include datasets will support data sharing and foster responsible scholarship.},

	abstract = {Abstract Discovering authoritative links between publications and the datasets that they use can be a labor-intensive process. We introduce a natural language processing pipeline that retrieves and reviews publications for informal references to research datasets, which complements the work of data librarians. We first describe the components of the pipeline and then apply it to expand an authoritative bibliography linking thousands of social science studies to the data-related publications in which they are used. The pipeline increases recall for literature to review for inclusion in data-related collections of publications and makes it possible to detect informal data references at scale. We contribute (1) a novel Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that reliably detects informal data references and (2) a dataset connecting items from social science literature with datasets they reference. Together, these contributions enable future work on data reference, data citation networks, and data reuse.},

	abstract = {Named-entity recognition (NER) is an important task required in a wide variety of applications. While rule-based systems are appealing due to their well-known "explainability," most, if not all, state-of-the-art results for NER tasks are based on machine learning techniques. Motivated by these results, we explore the following natural question in this paper: Are rule-based systems still a viable approach to named-entity recognition? Specifically, we have designed and implemented a high-level language NERL on top of SystemT, a general-purpose algebraic information extraction system. NERL is tuned to the needs of NER tasks and simplifies the process of building, understanding, and customizing complex rule-based named-entity annotators. We show that these customized annotators match or outperform the best published results achieved with machine learning techniques. These results confirm that we can reap the benefits of rule-based extractors' explainability without sacrificing accuracy. We conclude by discussing lessons learned while building and customizing complex rule-based annotators and outlining several research directions towards facilitating rule development.},
