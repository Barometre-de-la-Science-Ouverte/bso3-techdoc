# Discussion on software and dataset scope and sharing

## Objective

1) Define what should be considered as a "software" object in the scope of the French Open Science Monitor (Barom√®tre de la Science Ouverte, BSO)

2) Define what should be considered as a "dataset" object in the scope of the BSO

3) What are the minimal criteria for considering that a software or a dataset is shared ?

## 1) Software

From the point of view of software sharing, "research software" is usually software produced by researchers or by research software engineers. 

From the point of view of software citation, "research software" is software mentioned in scholar literature - this is "software of interest" for research. This could cover also general purposes and mainstream software such as Excel, Photoshop or PostgresSQL. 

Software products correspond in practice to various artefacts, which are not always obvious to consider as "software". This is particularly challenging from the point of view of software citation, but this remains an issue even when identifying software sharing. 

A standard definition of software is "a collection of computer programs that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it" (Wikipedia). Everything that can provide processing instructions to a computer, whatever its form, can therefore be seen as software.

The types/formats of software depend a lot on the technical domain and the used programing framework. 

- **Software** products typically can be published as standalone applications or libraries/plugins, either as executable code (binaries), package (e.g. R package, combining script and binaries), as a more comprehensive open source project (program, script, resources, document, build scripts, etc.), script to be exectuted within a particular software environment, source code that require manual building, small standalone script (e.g. "gist"), plaform (data, data management software and service software), web services, images to be executed as containers, or software embedded in an hardware device.

- The notion of **models** (machine learning models, simulation models) versus software is unclear. Models encode data processing and executable action/prediction process. They are however in a format closer to data, because the "instructions" are only digital transformations. Models themselves should be run in a software environment. Despite their "executable" nature, models are usually not considered as software. 

- **Algorithm** versus software: it is quite frequent that the name of an algorithm and its implementation (so as software) are used in papers in an interchangeable manner. While it is clear that we want to exclude "algorithm names" from software entities, they can be used to refer to the implementation. This is one of the most frequent ambiguity we have identified in Softcite and this was similarly reported by [3]. The distinction could sometime be done in context, but a guideline is necessary when the usage of the name is general and ambiguous on purpose. 

Examples: 

[10.1038/ng.2007.13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17952075/)

    Finally, we applied the EIGENSTRAT method [46], which relies on patterns of correlation 
    between individuals to detect stratification, to our Icelandic discovery sample. 

*EIGENSTRAT* here is the name of the method and of the software implementing the method.

[10.1038/bjc.2016.25](https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc201625)

    Messenger RNA expression was normalised to household gene expression (GAPDH and RPL13A 
    for BON-1; HPRT and YWAZ for QGP-1) according to the geNorm algorithm (Mestdagh et 
    al, 2009). 

*geNorm* is an algorithm and referenced as such above, but it is software too - and the software is actually used for the normalization in the described research.


- **Database** versus software: in scientific publications, it is quite frequent to mention a database name as a general service covering the data and  software to access/search the data (including web services and database management software, e.g. PostgresSQL). 

* PMC4863732

    PubMed MEDLINE

MEDLINE is at the same time a large metadata collection and a database service to query this catalogue. 

* 10.1002/pam.22030

    Data come from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) database

Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) is a database and an online platform.

The related guideline for the Softcite corpus [1] was as follow: 

    "The relevant distinction should be whether the text is referring to a data collection/dataset 
    (ie the data in the database) or to the software that provides access to a dataset. If it is 
    clear that they are referring to the data inside, it is not a reference to a software." 

The guideline thus also means that when it is not clear that we refer to the data inside the database, it should be considered as software too. 

- Very common is life science, **scientific devices** are used in most of the experiments. They usually includes software, embedded or to be install on a PC to control the device, process the aquired data, export the data, etc.. 

Example:

[PMC4644012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4644012/)

    The Gram-negative coccobacilli were initially identified as Pasturella pneumotropica by the 
    VITEK 2 system, software version 06.01 (BioMerieux, France) using the GN card, with bionumber 
    0001010210040001 and an excellent identification (probability 99%).

The [VITEK 2 system](https://www.biomerieux-usa.com/clinical/vitek-2-healthcare) embeds software performing predictions. 

Given the variety of software embodiments, what is mentioned is often larger system or devices including software. It is thus important to decide in context to which part the authors are referring to, and if the statement refers to the software part of the device. 

This is however less an issue for software sharing (software here is part of a commercial product, not really produced by researchers and described in a research publication), and it is more relevant to research software citation. 
 
- **Software components** of a more complete infrastructure: A reference is made to a general infrastructure, including some software components. For example in [10.20955/r.2018.1-16](http://herosolutions.com.pk/breera/foundation/images/whitepaper.pdf) "Bitcoin wallet". 

- Reference to a **programming languages**. For example:

[10.1257/jep.4.1.99](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.4.1.99)

    It is written in BASIC, a close analogue to FORTRAN.

Software language per se (written in BASIC, in FORTRAN, ...) are normally not software, but software tools for implementing a software language (like a C compiler, a Java virtual machine, an Integrated Development Environment like R-Studio, etc.) are. 

- Non-named usage of a programming environment. Software was produced on the environment (some code was written), but it is implicit, not shared, nor reusable. 

Example:

[10.1136/gut.2011.238386](https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/61/1/69.full.pdf)

    Multiple imputation was conducted in R 2.11." 

- When defining the scope of software, [2] introduces the following exclusions:

    We explicitly exclude database record numbers/identifiers (e.g., GO:0002474, Q8HWB0), file 
    formats (e.g., PDF), programming languages and their libraries (e.g., Python, BioPython), 
    operating systems (e.g., Linux), algorithms (e.g., Merge-Sort), methods (e.g., ANOVA, 
    Random Forests) and approaches (e.g., Machine Learning, Dynamic Programming)." 

[3] distinguishes 4 subtypes of software:

- Application, a standalone program, designed for end-users
(include web-based applications such as web-services).

- Plugin is an extension to a software that cannot be used in-
dividually (include libraries/R packages).

- Operating System (OS) 

- Programming Environment (includes compilers or interpreters)

When used together with a specific software mention, OS and programing environments can be considered as "attributes" of this software (e.g. running on Windows, developed with R-Studio). However, OS and programing environments can also be referenced as such. 


## 2) Dataset

Actual dataset mentions also present some heterogeneity, as observed for software, although we think in a less important manner. With variation of types, formats and access, the scope for "datasets" is not always clear. As far as we know, this is however not discussed in the literature. 

- **Implicit versus named datasets**: most mention of sets of data are implicit. The research study can mention some data acquisition, but the dataset is not named, nor shared. Most of the data discussed in papers in the biomedical field for instance are created for the study, but remain implicit and not shared. 

For example:

[10.1038/srep14168](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14168)

    The 47 tilapia DNA samples were sent to Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) for 101 bp 
    paired-end sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2500. 

The Illumina Hiseq 2500 device produces sequencing data, which are part of the described study. These data are however not named and not shared. 

The occurrence of a data acquisition device is usually a very reliable hint that some research data have been produced and could be shared for reproducibility and reuse reasons. In our dataset recognition approach, we are thus also trying to identify automatically mentions to data acquisition devices. 

Estimating the number of mentions of implicit datasets would be necessary to estimate the proportion of shared data (against all produced data) in a research work. 

- Mentioning a **database** rather than independent dataset: The main point here is usually if the research work refers to the data/dataset stored in the database or if some data has been loaded and shared via this database.

[2] for instance define a database as "any electronic resource that stores records in a structured form, and provides unique identifiers to each record". 
This is however identical to what is usually understood as a "dataset". In the case of the database, a software service layer is implied in the data delivery, in addition to a data storage which is binded to this software service. 

On the other hand, a "dataset" typically exists independently from a database management system and is not ambiguous. 

- Reference made not with a dataset name to a single dataset, but with a **data sharing initiative/project** name used to reference a collection of datasets developed by this initiative/project.

For example the Coleridge Kaggle dataset (which is a particularly "noisy", imprecise and incomplete annotated corpus) is annotating the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as a dataset name: 

    Genome-wide pathway analysis of memory impairment in the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging 
    Initiative (ADNI) cohort implicates gene candidates, canonical pathways, and networks.

This is however not a standard dataset citation. It informs about the origin and location of some data used in the research work, but does not describe precisely which data is considered. 

Very similar, we can see references to a large project/collaboration/experiments (*collaboration* in the sense of HEP or Astronomy, such as ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), for actually referencing data produced/shared by the collaboration and not the collaboration itself. 

- Reference to an **entry in a database**, for instance via a unique identifier such as an accession number. The dataset here is defined by the combination of the data service and the identifier. 

For example: 

https://doi.org/10.1038/nature21374
    
    The RNA-seq data generated in this study have been deposited in DDBJ under accession codes 
    DRA001101 and DRA004790."

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204936

    The mutations in selected resistance genes (gyrA, gryB, parC, parE, mexR, ampC, ampD and 
    ampR) of each strain were determined with reference to P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Genbank RefSeq 
    accession no. NC_002516.2).

- **Primary versus secondary data**: It is normally expected that the raw primary data are shared (e.g. sequence data, MR images, etc.) and it appears usually the case from the existing manually labeled corpus. 

As example for primary data:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2016.03.004

    anonymized sequence data can be accessed online under the accession number 
    PRJEB12853 at the European Nucleotide Archive.

However, sometimes only secondary data (analysis of raw data, summary of raw data, etc.) are shared. The sharing could be limited to the values of a figure or table that underline characteristics of raw data. 

Similarly the sharing of data can be limited to the reference of figures or tables in the article (which is a human presentation of a summary of some researchdata), for example:

[PMC6956868](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956868/)

    The data supporting this article are available in Figures 1‚Äì12. 


## 3) Sharing

The form of sharing statements, the nature of the shared data/software and the proportion of shared data can vary significantly. Examining the publications in a bottom-up approach shows that data sharing is not a dichotomy (shared/not shared), but rather shades of grey, which makes it complicated to decide which criteria and sharing "threshold" should be considered. 

- Sharing statement corresponding to **no actual public data sharing**: "data available on reasonable demand"

Furthermore, such promise/intent expressions actually indicate that, on the contrary, the data will in general not be shared at all, even on fair demand, see [4] "Among 1792 manuscripts in which DAS indicated that authors are willing to share their data, 1670 (93%) authors either did not respond or declined to share their data with us.". Note that such disappointing data sharing rate was reported in [6], but higher rates after request to share the data were reported in [7] for studies in Psychology. 

- Sharing statement on **secured domain**: the data is shared but not available without some authorization and credentials validation process

- **Partial sharing**: only some data of the study are shared, this is the most common case of data sharing
    * sharing of secondary/analysis data, but not of primary data (e.g. sharing of the data points of figures)
    * cherry pick-up data sharing: "relevant" data
    * partial data sharing without further discussion

- **Insufficient or invalid data sharing**: 

    * case of partial reuse of a dataset/database, the authors cite properly the shared dataset where a selection of data is made, but do not disclose/share openly which subset is used for experiments
    * sharing is stated with some public URI, but the links are invalid/outdated
    * "data are available in article and/or supplementary data", which means that the figures/tables are supposed to disclose the data. However, what is disclosed is a visualization, a summary or a selection of the data, not in an exploitable format for computers, and not the actual and usable primary data.

For example:

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13064-019-0127-z

    All data generated of analyzed during the current study are included in this
    published article.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210388

    All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files

These vague statements are very common and introduce a major difference between declared and actual sharing of data (e.g. via URL, Datacite PID, accession number, ...). In [5] for instance in relation to clinical trial data: 

    In this cross-sectional study of 487 clinical trials published in JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine, 334 articles (68.6%) declared data sharing. Only 2 (0.6%) individual-participant data sets were actually deidentified and publicly available on a journal website

**Note 1:** The usage of data sharing statements (as an independent section at the end of an article) is limited to certain technical domains and journals, mainly bio-medicine and natural sciences. Without data sharing statement requirements, the sharing is usually clearer for text mining because the authors are not forced by a kind of bureacratic statement requirement which often result in some obfuscation: they disclose the shared datasets and how to access them or they say nothing about the availability of data. On the other hand, data sharing is then less frequent and requires much more sophisticated text mining process to be captured, with lower recall. 

**Note 2**: These issues were already observed from early data sharing policies. For instance, PLOS requests the authors to include systematically a data availability statement. However, [8] reported that only about 20% of the statements indicate that data are deposited in a repository (which is "strongly recommended" by PLOS data sharing policy). In addition, satisfying the level of sharing required in the PLOS policy, even with data deposit in a repository, was unclear.  

- In general, we can expect to be able to determine that a certain proportion of research article shares "some" data effectively (not just stating a possibility of request for data or an intend):
    * we cannot judge the comprehensiveness of the shared data
    * we need to identify evidence of actual sharing e.g. url, data repository, permanent identifier to access that some data is shared
    * a mention of the usage of some selection of research data available online (e.g. "we used samples from GenBank") is not enough to determine which data is used and is not shared data
    * vague statements like "all relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files" (typical PLOS One) or "All relevant data are within the manuscript" very rarely match the usual expected requirements of data sharing
